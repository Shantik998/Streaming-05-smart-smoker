"""
    This program sends a message to a queue on the RabbitMQ server every 30 seconds.
    Timestamps of temperatures are sent to queues based on whether or not the temperature is of the smoker, Food A, or Food B.
    Messages come from a csv file of smoker temps.
    Make tasks harder/longer-running by adding dots at the end of the message.
